# K-Means
Initialization for K-means clustering using Voronoi diagram

K-Means algorithm is one of the famous clustering unsupervised techniques that has numerous applications. The major problem in this method is that it doesn't ensure global optimum solution due to random selection of initial cluster centers.

# Proposed-Method
The initial clusters are selected with the help of Voronoi Diagram constructed from the given set of data points. The proposed method automates the selection of the initial clusters to supply them for K-Means. We have used the famous Iris Dataset as input to this method. The categorization is done in both normal K-Means and our proposed method.
